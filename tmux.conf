# Indexing & Window Management
# ------------------------------------------------------------

# Start numbering for windows and panes from 1 instead of 0.
# This makes it more intuitive for most users who are used to
# 1-based indexing (e.g., in their minds, the first window is "1").
set -g base-index 1          # Set window numbering to start from 1
setw -g pane-base-index 1    # Set pane numbering to start from 1 for each window

# Automatically renumber windows when one is closed.
# This prevents gaps in window numbering (e.g., if you close window 2,
# window 3 will become window 2, and so on), keeping your window list tidy.
set-option -g renumber-windows on


set -g mouse on # Enable mouse-scrollback with wheel
set -g history-limit 10000 # Keep 10,000 lines in history

# Terminal Emulation & Colors
# ------------------------------------------------------------

# Set the default terminal type for new windows and panes.
# This is CRITICAL for proper display, colors, and especially
# correct line wrapping behavior, preventing issues like
# prompts overwriting themselves.

# Option 1: Generally Recommended (Modern Tmux & Terminal Emulators)
# Use 'tmux-256color' for Tmux versions 2.6+ when your system's ncurses
# is new enough (often the case on modern Linux distros and macOS).
# This provides the most accurate terminal capabilities for Tmux itself.
set -g default-terminal "tmux-256color"

# Option 2: Fallback / Wider Compatibility
# If 'tmux-256color' causes issues, or for older Tmux versions,
# 'screen-256color' is a widely supported and usually reliable alternative.
# Uncomment the line below and comment out the 'tmux-256color' line above if needed.
# set -g default-terminal "screen-256color"

# IMPORTANT:
# For optimal results, ensure the TERM environment variable in your
# *outer* terminal emulator (e.g., Alacritty, iTerm2, Konsole, GNOME Terminal)
# is also set to a 256-color compatible value (like xterm-256color, alacritty, etc.)
# and ideally, matches the capabilities of what you set above.
# A mismatch between the outer TERM and tmux's default-terminal can cause issues.
